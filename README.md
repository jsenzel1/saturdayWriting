# saturdayWriting
A stream of consciousness writing experiment. On Saturdays (or Sundays sometimes). I write something stream of consciousness. It's only if and when I feel like it (I made this repo to organize the writings I already found myself doing on saturdays, not necesarily to force myself to do something every week)
