feelings of weirdness definitely starting to come in 

today I got hit with a sort of burst of productive/constructive energy in the late afternoon. Not for today specifically but for the quarantine experience in general. As I do, I wrote a list with different things that I want to do in each day of quaratine and tried to come up with structure etc. 

The truth is I'm starting to miss being outside already and it hasn't been long at all. Althought weirdly I'm glad to be doing this totally alone in a way. Maybe it makes me feel a bit more loopy but spending more than 24 hours with any human on earth generally makes me sick of them to be honest and I think around now i would start getting in fights with just about anyone. 

I've been feeling a little guilty or fomo-ish about not doing interesting work during this time but saw someting online today about not having to write your great novel right now and made me feel a bit better. Hopefully these logs will be something slightly interesting to look back on. 

I see now that once this is all over there will be a huge excitement around totally normal activities like going to get a coffee or hanging out with friends etc. That's exciting to me in a sense. We will all have this collective sense of the fragility of society and all that (I know, this observation ranks in freqeuncy just below "wow everyone's buying lots of toilet paper") 

Anyway there's these fold out mirrors in our bathroom that you can point at each other in a triangle making an infinite mirror and this wraparound 3d effect, and just before writing this I spent a good 6 to 7 minutes just sticking my face in it and making weird expressions, if that gives an idea of what flavor of oddness the situation is imparting right now. 

It sort of feels like what I imagine getting cancer is like, or being in a huge accident, or going to war, or getting married, or (this one I actually do have recent experience with) moving to a new country. Everything is changing all at once and the possibilities of the future begin to expand to the point where they're so vast that you're left dealing with the concept of their vastness rather than the possibilities themselves. The seperation between this event and the others mentioned is that this is happening all at once, everywhere in the world, to . Last week I wrote about this having a similar feeling to a world war and I feel that way more and more so. In a sense though I also feel a comradorary in all of this, a morbid togetherness. 

And with the full 100% unending spout of infomration and concentration on the situation, there arises in all of us a parallel, silly-face-in-the-mirror-making self, that has decided to defend against all of this by acting out. 

I like this little consciousness within a consciousness, it's what keeps us sane sometimes, it's why we laught at holocaust jokes, and why laughing and crying sometimes meet and meld with each other. It's the thing within us that comes out when the scale of information or emotion or perception is out of our order of dealable magnitude, and we must cope in this advanced evolutionary way, or shut down completely. 

perhaps then I'll carry on with this idea in my actions, and I'll be ok with watching garbage television, and doing whatever else I'm doing right now. Who knows what any of us needs at this moment. 

The whole thing has an odd sense of clumsy metaphor and sloppy poetry. We try to find connection while forced to stand at physical lengths, and battle an invisible enemy while the sun shines in spring. If I were an 11th grade creative writing teaching I think it would get a slight eye rolling "B-", "good voice, show don't tell"
